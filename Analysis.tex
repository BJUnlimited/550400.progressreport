Because this model is based on qualitative observation it is imperative to clearly define simplifications and assumpitions we have made in the model.
\paragraph{Simplifications and Assumptions}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The willingness of an individual member of a crowd to cheer depends on the number of people cheering around the individual as well as how long the people around him/her have been cheering. The greater the number of people surrounding a fan who are cheering, and the longer the surrounding people have been cheering, the more likely the fan will start to cheer.
	\item The cheering of the individual depends on the innate support level the individual has for the team.
	\item Once a fan starts to cheer, he/she continues cheering until the end of the simulation.
	\item The performance of a team does NOT influence cheering.
	\end{itemize}

%\paragraph {Simplifications and Assumptions}
%
%The stimulus in this case would be the performance of the team. For the purpose of simplicity we will assume that the stimulus is average. From there, we can take a snap shot of the crowd's behavior and ignore the dependence of cheering on the team's performance. Each snap shot can be represented by a "round".  
%\newline
%For the internal state of the individual we can assign base "cheer number" using a stochastic process. We will simplify cheering as a probabilistic switch with a universal threshold that if exceeded the individual will be considered cheering otherwise the indivdual will not be cheering. This will simplify the problem because it will allow us to ignore the continuos gradient and different levels of cheering. 
%\newline
%We will simplify the relationship of the willingness to cheer and the surrounding individuals to only include the individuals that are directly surrounding the intended member.

\paragraph {Computational Simulation} \newline

Using MATLAB, we start by generating an arbitrary sized $n~x~m$ matrix $X$ to represent a $nm$ sized crowd. The number of rows, n, and columns, m, can be changed based on the user's liking. The generated matrix represents a crowd where each element represents an individual in the crowd. The first matrix generated was filled randomly with  each fans innate support level, $C_{innate}$. Each fans innate support level was generated by sampling from a normal random distribution with the mean set to 10 and the standard deviation of 1 as shown in (\ref{1}). We can use a normal random variable because we can consider cheering to be an introduced innovation \cite{DI2003}. In general, the mean and standard deviation is intrinsic to each crowd. However, in this model the mean was set to 10 and the standard deviation was set to 1 to ensure that it is highly unlikely that a fan was assigned a negative innate support level. (i.~e.~it is very unlikely to sample a number from this distribution that is more then 10 standard deviations from the mean.) This makes the math much easier when considering the dependence on the surrounding members, as it will be revealed later.

\begin{equation}
X_{ij}\sim Norm(10,1), i\in[1,n], j\in[1,m]
\label{1}
\end{equation}

Next, we set an initial threshold, $T_{init}$, to be 11, one standard deviation above the mean of the normal distribution. The initial threshold is used to determine which of the fans in the matrix are \textit{initially} cheering. Another $nxm$ matrix, $X'$ was then created. Each element in $X'$ is assigned a value of 1, if the corresponding element in $X$ exceeded the initial threshold, otherwise the element is given a value of 0. $X'$ is the matrix used to keep track of who is cheering. See \ref{2}.

\begin{equation}
X'_{ij}=1~if~X_{ij}\geq T_{init}, X'_{ij}=0~if~X_{ij}<T_{init}
\label{2}
\end{equation}

As stated above, a whether a fan starts to cheer depends on how many adjacent fans are cheering, $S$, as well as the length of time those fans have been cheering, $R$. $S$ is a $nxm$ matrix which stores how many people surrounding a given fan are cheering at a given time. We define a round, $R$, to be the passing of an arbitrary time interval (approximately 3-5 seconds, in this case). We then create a third $nxm$ matrix, $Y$ and and compute the individual elements of $Y$ according to \ref{3}. We then compare each of the elements in $Y$ to an absolute threshold, $T_{absolute}$. If an individual's score in $Y$ exceeds the absolute threshold, the individual will begin to cheer, and we set the corresponding element in $X'$ equal to 1.  This is shown in \ref{4}. If the individual's core in $Y$ is less then the absolute threshold, we do nothing to the corresponding element in $X'$ (i.e. it remains 0). We repeat this process for each round until we reach desired number of rounds. During each round, we take snapshots of the crowds by storing $X'$ for that round. 

\begin{equation}
Y_{ij}=X_{ij}S_{ij}+R, i\in[1,n], j\in[1,m]
\label{3}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
X'_{ij}=1~if~X_{ij}\geq T_{absolute}
\label{4}
\end{equation}

The final output is a graphical representation of of the cheering behavior over a $R$ rounds as well as the percentage of fans who were cheering in each round.
