\prefacesection{Introduction}
\paragraph{}
A loud and supportive home crowd is the ultimate home team advantage to any sports team. Past research has shown that the home crowd advantage can have a profound effect on deciding who wins a sporting event \cite{Jamieson_2010}. Across all major professional sporting leagues in the United States, the home team of any sporting event wins approximately 60\% of the time, a statistically significantly higher winning percentage then the expected 50\% \cite{Jamieson_2010}. The home crowd advantage is even more evident in college athletics. Studies have shown that in certain collegiate sports, the home team wins up to 66\% of the games played \cite{Snyder_1985}. 

\paragraph{}
In addition to helping the home team win, a loud and supportive home crowd can also improve the ambience of a sporting event. Whether fans are chanting the school fight song, waving a rally towel, doing the wave, or doing general applause, the fans are showing support for the home team as well as enhancing the general atmosphere of a sporting event. (Note that all of these action will hence be collectively termed ``cheering''.) For this and previously stated reasons, cheering is essential at collegiate sporting events. Cheering improves the collegiate sporting experience for both the atheletic teams as well as the fans. 

\paragraph{}
Johns Hopkins University, located in Baltimore, Maryland, has a proud athletic tradition to go along with it long standing repuation for strong academics. The Johns Hopkins University Blue Jays have amassed 47 national championships and 187 conference titles \cite{hopathletic}. The Blue Jays have excelled at many sports including Men's Lacrosse, Men's Swimming, Men's Football, and Men's Baseball. The Men's Lacrosse team has won 44 National Championships, most recently in 2007, while the Men's Swimming team won 32 conference championships, including an astounding streak of 28 consecutive conference championships from 1971-1998 \cite{hopathletic}. More recently, the Men's Football and Baseball teams were each conference champions for three consecutive years from 2009 through 2011 \cite{hopathletic}. As with any collegiate athletic program, Johns Hopkins University and it's supporters are always looking for ways to improve its athletic teams' performance and continue in their winning ways.

\prefacesection{Technical and Non-Technical Background}
\paragraph{} 
Blue Jays Unlimited (BJU), established in 1995, is a volunteer group of alumni, friends and staff dedicated to supporting and promoting Johns Hopkins athletics \cite{bjuwebsite}. BJU is the official booster club for Johns Hopkins athletics and has more than 3000 active members, who have raised more than \$4 million in funds to improve the Johns Hopkins athletic experience for both student athletes and fans alike \cite{bjuwebsite}. These funds provide money for capital projects as well as scholarship and operational endowments \cite{bjuwebsite}. Past BJU projects have included renovations of the Newton H.~White Athletic Center as well as recognition banners for championship teams \cite{bjuwebsite}.

\paragraph{}
BJU is present at nearly all major Johns Hopkins sporting events to encourage fans to support their Blue Jays in a vociferous and family-friendly manner to propel their Hopkins' teams to victory. It is their goal to provide Johns Hopkins' athletic teams with a spirited home crowd to cheer them on. As such, BJU is interested in maximizing the amount of fan participation in cheering at sporting events held on Homewood Field at the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University. More specifically, they believe that they can increase fan participaton in cheering events by strategically placing ``cheer starters'' in the home crowd to lead and urge other fans to participate in cheering. Cheer starters are student volunteers who urge other fans around them to cheer.

	\label{fig:homewoodfield}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
Consider the satelite image of Homewood Field in Figure \ref{fig:homewoodfield} courtesy of Google Maps. Homewood Field's capacity is approximately 8500 spectators \cite{wiki}. The long rectangular section of bleachers in the lower left of portion of the image seats approximately 4000 fans and is traditionally reserved for Blue Jays' fans. For nearly all major Hopkins' sporting events, these home team bleachers are filled to capacity. As such, BJU is specifically interested in maximizing the fan cheering in these home team bleachers.

\prefacesection{Problem Statement and Objectives}
{\bf{\Large Problem Statement}}
\paragraph{}
BJU wants to know if cheer starters can actually increase cheering and also want a simple model of fan participation in cheering.
\newline
\newline
{\bf{\Large Objectives}}
\paragraph{}
Our task is to provide BJU with a simple model of fan participation in cheering at Homewood Field in the home team bleachers as well as simulation results from the model which determine if their belief about cheer starters is accurate. If cheer starters are found to be effective, we will attempt to provide BJU with more details about the quantity and location at which cheer starters should be placed in order to maximize cheering, time permitting.

\prefacesection{Analysis}
Because this model is based on qualitative observation it is imperative to clearly define simplifications and assumpitions we have made in the model.
\paragraph{Simplifications and Assumptions}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The willingness of an individual member of a crowd to cheer depends on the number of people cheering around the individual as well as how long the people around him/her have been cheering. The greater the number of people surrounding a fan who are cheering, and the longer the surrounding people have been cheering, the more likely the fan will start to cheer.
	\item The cheering of the individual depends on the innate support level the individual has for the team.
	\item Once a fan starts to cheer, he/she continues cheering until the end of the simulation.
	\item The performance of a team does NOT influence cheering.
	\end{itemize}

%\paragraph {Simplifications and Assumptions}
%
%The stimulus in this case would be the performance of the team. For the purpose of simplicity we will assume that the stimulus is average. From there, we can take a snap shot of the crowd's behavior and ignore the dependence of cheering on the team's performance. Each snap shot can be represented by a "round".  
%\newline
%For the internal state of the individual we can assign base "cheer number" using a stochastic process. We will simplify cheering as a probabilistic switch with a universal threshold that if exceeded the individual will be considered cheering otherwise the indivdual will not be cheering. This will simplify the problem because it will allow us to ignore the continuos gradient and different levels of cheering. 
%\newline
%We will simplify the relationship of the willingness to cheer and the surrounding individuals to only include the individuals that are directly surrounding the intended member.

\paragraph {Computational Simulation} \newline

Using MATLAB, we start by generating an arbitrary sized $n~x~m$ matrix $X$ to represent a $nm$ sized crowd. The number of rows, n, and columns, m, can be changed based on the user's liking. The generated matrix represents a crowd where each element represents an individual in the crowd. The first matrix generated was filled randomly with  each fans innate support level, $C_{innate}$. Each fans innate support level was generated by sampling from a normal random distribution with the mean set to 10 and the standard deviation of 1 as shown in (\ref{1}). We can use a normal random variable because we can consider cheering to be an introduced innovation \cite{DI2003}. In general, the mean and standard deviation is intrinsic to each crowd. However, in this model the mean was set to 10 and the standard deviation was set to 1 to ensure that it is highly unlikely that a fan was assigned a negative innate support level. (i.~e.~it is very unlikely to sample a number from this distribution that is more then 10 standard deviations from the mean.) This makes the math much easier when considering the dependence on the surrounding members, as it will be revealed later.

\begin{equation}
X_{ij}\sim Norm(10,1), i\in[1,n], j\in[1,m]
\label{1}
\end{equation}

Next, we set an initial threshold, $T_{init}$, to be 11, one standard deviation above the mean of the normal distribution. The initial threshold is used to determine which of the fans in the matrix are \textit{initially} cheering. Another $nxm$ matrix, $X'$ was then created. Each element in $X'$ is assigned a value of 1, if the corresponding element in $X$ exceeded the initial threshold, otherwise the element is given a value of 0. $X'$ is the matrix used to keep track of who is cheering. See (\ref{2}).

\begin{equation}
X'_{ij}=1~if~X_{ij}\geq T_{init}, X'_{ij}=0~if~X_{ij}<T_{init}
\label{2}
\end{equation}

As stated above, a whether a fan starts to cheer depends on how many adjacent fans are cheering, $S$, as well as the length of time those fans have been cheering, $R$. $S$ is a $nxm$ matrix which stores how many people surrounding a given fan are cheering at a given time. We define a round, $R$, to be the passing of an arbitrary time interval (approximately 3-5 seconds, in this case). We then create a third $nxm$ matrix, $Y$ and and compute the individual elements of $Y$ according to (\ref{3}). We then compare each of the elements in $Y$ to an absolute threshold, $T_{absolute}$. If an individual's score in $Y$ exceeds the absolute threshold, the individual will begin to cheer, and we set the corresponding element in $X'$ equal to 1.  This is shown in (\ref{4}). If the individual's core in $Y$ is less then the absolute threshold, we do nothing to the corresponding element in $X'$ (i.e. it remains 0). We repeat this process for each round until we reach desired number of rounds. During each round, we take snapshots of the crowds by storing $X'$ for that round. 

\begin{equation}
Y_{ij}=X_{ij}S_{ij}+R, i\in[1,n], j\in[1,m]
\label{3}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
X'_{ij}=1~if~X_{ij}\geq T_{absolute}
\label{4}
\end{equation}

The final output is a graphical representation of of the cheering behavior over a $R$ rounds as well as the percentage of fans who were cheering in each round.

    \caption{Graphical representation of cheering in a 20 x 100 crowd for ten rounds. White lines seperate the results of each round. White represents the fans who are cheering and black represents fans who aren't cheering.}

    \caption{Increasing overall percentage of people cheering for ten rounds.}
    \label{fig:graph2}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
Figure \ref{fig:graph1} and Figure \ref{fig:graph2} were generated by running our simulations with the following parameters: $n=20$, $m=100$,$T_{init}=11$, $T_{absolute}=45}$, and 10 rounds. As can be seen in \ref{fig:graph1} and \ref{fig:graph2}, our model predicts that as the rounds progress, more and more fans will begin to cheer. 

\begin{figure}[h]

        \includegraphics[height=2.5in]{sample_graph3.jpg}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Graphical representation of cheering in a 20 x 100 crowd for ten rounds. White lines seperate the results of each round. White represents the fans who are cheering and black represents fans who aren't cheering.}
    \label{fig:graph3}

\begin{figure}[h]

        \includegraphics[width=3in]{sample_graph4.jpg}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Increasing overall percentage of people cheering for ten rounds.}
    \label{fig:graph4}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
Figure \ref{fig:graph3} and Figure \ref{fig:graph4} were generated by running our simulations with all the parameters set the same as in Figure \ref{fig:graph1} and Figure \ref{fig:graph2} except that $T_{absolute}$ was set to 50. It is clear that by increasing $T_{absolute}$ the percentage of fans who end up cheering decreases. This makes sense since a higher absolute threshold value will be harder to reach, and thus less fans will exceed the threshold and start cheering. 

\ifthenelse{\boolean{@twoside}}{\myclearpage}{}
\prefacesection{Remaining Work to be Done}
\paragraph{}
For our current model, we picked sample parameters for purposes of demonstration so far. For example, our initial threshold is 11 (one standard deviation above the normal distribution centered at 10), and the absolute threshold is 45. The simulation runs for 10 rounds for a crowd of 2,000 people (20 x 100). However, we have not yet determined an absolute set of model parameters for the entire project. For the remaining time we have to work on this project, we must pick a definitive initial threshold, absolute threshold, size of the crowd (i.e. $n$ and $m$), the number of rounds, and also incorporate cheer starters into the model.
\paragraph{}
We must also investigate the effect of cheer starters on the percentage of fans cheering in the final round. As stated above, the current model does not take into account of cheer starters; rather, it simulates a stochastic, general crowd susceptible to the influence of people cheering around them. Once all the parameters are finalized (including the number of cheer starters), we plan to randomly place the cheer starters within the crowd. We can then use Monte Carlo simulations to determine the average percentage of fans cheering at end of the final round when there are no cheer starters and also when the cheer starters are randomly placed in the crowd. If the final cheering percentage is statistically greater with cheer starters then without, it would demonstrate that cheer starters are effective in increasing cheering. 
 
\paragraph{}
If time permits, we could also add a function to our model which allows us to manually dictate where the cheer starters are placed. This would allow us to try and find patterns in cheer starter placement which maximize cheering. Right now, we hypothesize that certain regions of the crowd will have more people cheering than other locations and certain patterns will produce a large percentage of overall people cheering than other patterns.

\paragraph{}
Finally, we can complete the project by polishing the code in MATLAB and writing R documentation for an R package. We will also need to write a final report that introduces the project, explains the approach, and analyzes the results. We will also prepare a final presentation for this project.
